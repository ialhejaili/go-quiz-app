# go-quiz-app

A CLI app that utilizes the OpenAI API to generate dynamic multiple-choice questions based on topics
entered by the user. It allows users to interactively choose a topic, answer questions, receive instant
feedback, and proceed to the next question. The app provides a flexible and engaging user experience for
learning and assessment.

### Set Environment Variables
Before running the application, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file should contain your OpenAI API key.


1- Create a .env file in the root directory of your project:
```sh
   touch .env
```

2- Add your OpenAI API key to the .env file:
```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```
